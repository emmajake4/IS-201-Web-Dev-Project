                        <h3>My Background</h3>
                        <p>Growing up, I always had a fascination with the ocean.  My family had a property on the island of Maui that we frequently visited, and my love for the water and the magnificent beaches only grew with time.  Eventually as I got older, I started to understand and realize the danger my favorite ecosystems were in. These sacred places needed to be protected.  Iâ€™ve made it my mission to do all I can to protect the ocean environments so that little girls like me can grow up with that same wonder and fascination for the natural beauty of the Earth that I did.

                                    <li>I graduated high school from Desert Hills High School located in sunny, warm St. George, Utah.</li>
                                    <li>After high school, I applied and was accepted to my dream school, Brigham Young University.</li>
                                    <li>I'm currently a sophomore at BYU studying business with a planned minor in Marine Biology.</li>

                        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In high school I enjoyed being my own boss and teaching around 20 students piano lessons weekly. This taught me hard work, money management skills, and how to teach.</li>
                                    <li>For about a year I worked as a Medical Assistant at Southwest Skin and Cancer, a dermatology clinic in St. George. While there, I learned a lot about proper skincare, including the importance of sunscreen. I also had much hands on experience treating skin cancer, repairing suture wounds, and comforting patients.</li>
                                    <li>I worked for a year at a car wash. This drove me to work hard and keep my body healthy and strong so that I could stand the serious physical labor in the intense heat of Southern Utah in the summer. I was able to learn a lot from that experience.</li>
                                    <li>While working at the car wash, I also began my own business of selling ocean resin art pieces. This unlocked my creative side and allowed me ot spend my time finding ways to express my love of all things ocean and water. I am still working at this.</li>
                                    <li>I'm currently a representative for OCEANA which is a non-profit that is devoted to earning money to benefit and protect the oceans. This job utilizes my passion for ocean conservation and is a good outlet for me to feel like I'm making a difference and helping out.</li>
